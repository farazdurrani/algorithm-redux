# Algorithm
Algorithm Practice such as divide-and-conquer, greedy algorithm, dynamic programming, graph theory, etc

So far, this repo contains practice for:

* InsertionSort
* MergeSort
* QuickSort
* HeapSort
* MaxProrityQueue
* MinPriorityQueue
* MaximumSubArray Divide and Conquer and Brute Force approaches
* Matrix Multiplication Brute Force approach
* Single LinkedList (and Queues and Stacks).
* Double LinkedList

LinkedList contains all standard operations including removing a specific element and reversing it. 

* Binary Search Tree 

BST contains the following operations:

* BST Operations:
  - Invert
  - Insert (both iterative and recursive)
  - Find (both iterative and recursive)
  - Remove (both iterative and recursive)
  - Height
  - Level Order Traversal (Iterative and Queue approaches (separate))
  - Pre, In, and Post traversals recursive and iterative
  - Successor (by keeping track of parent node. And without tracking parent node)
  - Predecessor (by keeping track of parent node. And without tracking parent node)
  - Min and max (both iterative and recursive)
  - Print leaf nodes only


* Red Black Tree
  - Insert and InsertRBFix
  - Delete and DeleteRBFix

* HashTable (Using LinkedList in each bucket)

* Dynamic Programming (memoization)
  - Cut Rod using top-down and bottom-up approaches.
  - Longest Common Subsequence (naive recursive approach and DP-approach)
  - 0-1 (Binary) Knapsack Problem
  - Change-making 
  	- Minimum Number of Coins (bottom-up and top-down)
  	- Unique Ways to make change (bottom up)
  - Fibonacci (naive, bottom-up, top-down)
  
* Greedy Algorithm
  - Activity Selection Problem (recursive and iterative)
  - Fractional Knapsack Problem
  - Huffman Code (pseudo-code only)
  
* Graph
  - Breadth-First-Search
  - Depth-First-Search
  - Transpose of a Graph
  - Topological Sort
  - Strongly Connected Components
  - Find and print cycles in a directed graph using DFS.
  - Find Cycles in an undirected graph using DFS. 
   
* Minimum-Spanning-Tree
  - Prim's Algorithm

* Single-Source Shortest Paths
  - Bellman-Ford
  - DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS
  - Dijkstra
