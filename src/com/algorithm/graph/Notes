When finding shortest paths, there cannot be negative-weight cycles. 

* Use Bellman-Ford if there are regular cycles and contains 
negative weights (this is different than negative-weight cycles.

* Use DAG-Shortest-Path if it's a DAG (directed "ACYCLIC" graph) and could
contains negative weights.

* Use Dijkstra if there are regular cycles but no negative weights.

Only Dijstra is greedy.
